# Two_Sigma
The Two Sigma Financial Modeling Challenge on Kaggle.com is an opportunity to explore financial forecasting in a controlled setting. While we are not given the specific details of the variables, basic exploratory data analysis can give us some important clues as to the importance of the variables. The core of the problem is twofold, identify the variables that best represent the Y, and then work to apply the time series techniques learned in the class to the data itself.
